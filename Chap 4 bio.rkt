When I was younger,
growing up in a household with two languages made for an interesting perspective of the way I spoke to others.
Respect followed, of course as my parented demanded I rely not solely on brute strength,
that my mind could move mountains where my body would become exhausted.
I owe a lot of my mannerisms from my father,
who spoke only when he deemed it necessary, and not waste a word so callously.
My mother taught me spanish in an effort to speak and understand my other family members who hail from Mexico and other spanish dominated lands.
Learning to code and all the practices that come with it are a gentle reminder of the language format I used before to develop my english and spanish speaking skills.
To use words where there were only gaps of information instead.
Gestures, when body language came in to play.
Context, where there are pieces to a story that haven't had a chance to show themselves
just yet.
Public speaking is not simply speaking in public, it is having a voice and a message to deliver to the ears and hearts of those with capacity to listen and understand.
Now, with the addition of the internet,
the entire world is a stage and I am under it's spotlight.")
